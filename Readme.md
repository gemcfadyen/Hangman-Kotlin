# Hangman

## Rules
The computer will select a word that the user should guess letter by letter, inputting your guess via the command line.

You have six lives to begin with. Each incorrect guess results in a lost life.

The game is over when the word is correctly guessed by inputting all the correct letters, or you run out of lives.

## Run the game
To start the game, invoke the main method found in `Hangman.kt`.
